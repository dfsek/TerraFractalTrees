# Terra Fractal Tree Addon

This addon implements BetterEnd Fractal Trees in Terra.
These used to be included by default, but were removed in 5.1.0
to better suit our goal of being platform-agnostic.

## Installation
Add the Addon ID `FractalTrees` to the `pack.yml` in the pack you want to use
the trees with. Example:
```yaml
addons:
  - FractalTrees
```

## Usage
The trees added require no additional configuration, and may be used in any biome
out-of-the-box. List of trees:

|ID|Description|
|--|-----------|
|GIANT_OAK|Giant procedurally generated Oak tree|
|GIANT_SPRUCE|Giant procedurally generated Spruce tree|
|LARGE_SHATTERED_PILLAR|Large Shattered End Pillar, may generate an End Crystal on top|
|SHATTERED_LARGE|Large Shattered Forest Tree|
|SHATTERED_SMALL|Small Shattered Forest Tree|
|SMALL_SHATTERED_PILLAR|Small Shattered End Pillar|
